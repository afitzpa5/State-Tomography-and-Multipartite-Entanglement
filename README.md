# State-Tomography-and-Multipartite-Entanglement
This is the location for Qiskit code written to study state tomography performed on GHZ gates. The gates are implemented using IBM's cloud accessed quantum chips.

The result scraper script is a short piece of code to plot the measurement probabilities for a given job result. It is useful if you are working offline and want to get the plots of your experiments without logging into IBM quantum lab.
